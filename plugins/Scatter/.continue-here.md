# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief finalized for Scatter. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Granular reversed delay with stuttering grains, randomized pitch quantization, and stereo randomization
- Parameters specified: 9 parameters (Delay Time, Grain Size, Grain Density, Pitch Random, Scale, Root Note, Pan Random, Feedback, Mix)
- UI vision captured: Grain cloud visualization showing position in time/stereo/pitch space
- Use cases identified: Textural ambience, evolving soundscapes, abstract musical atmospheres

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start implementation directly
3. Research similar plugins for inspiration

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Effect (Delay)
- Core concept: Granular reversed delay with beautiful stuttering grains, pitch quantization to musical scales, and randomized stereo placement
- Tempo sync: Yes, with note values for delay time
- Grain behavior: Random forward/reverse per grain, overlap-based density, windowed playback
- Pitch randomization: ±7 semitones quantized to selected scale/root
- Primary use case: Textural ambience and evolving soundscapes
