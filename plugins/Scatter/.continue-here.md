# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 0 - Research & Planning Complete

DSP architecture documented and implementation plan created. Ready to proceed to implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type: Effect (Granular Reversed Delay)
- Complexity tier: 5-6 (DEEP research - 30 minutes)
- Professional examples researched: Output Portal, Red Panda Particle, GrainScanner, Audio Damage Quanta 2
- JUCE modules identified: juce_dsp (DelayLine, WindowingFunction, DryWetMixer), juce_core (Random)
- DSP feasibility verified: All primitives map to JUCE classes or simple custom code
- Parameter ranges researched
- Complexity score: 5.0
- Strategy: Phase-based implementation
- Plan documented with 5 phases (3 DSP phases, 2 GUI phases)
- Estimated duration: 20-25 hours total

## Next Steps

1. Stage 2: Foundation + Shell (create build system and parameters) - Run /implement Scatter
2. Review architecture.md and plan.md
3. Pause here

## Files Created
- plugins/Scatter/.ideas/architecture.md (Complete DSP specification with 10 core components)
- plugins/Scatter/.ideas/plan.md (Phase breakdown: 3 DSP phases, 2 GUI phases)

## Context to Preserve

**Architecture highlights:**
- Granular synthesis engine: 64 polyphonic grain voices with Hann windowing
- Pitch shifting: Playback rate adjustment (time-domain, not phase vocoder)
- Scale quantization: 5 scale types (Chromatic, Major, Minor, Pentatonic, Blues)
- Real-time visualization: Particle field showing grain positions (200×200px)
- Feedback loop: Grain output → delay buffer input for evolving textures

**Implementation strategy:**
- Phase 3.1 (6-8h): Core granular engine
- Phase 3.2 (3-4h): Pitch shifting + scale quantization
- Phase 3.3 (3-4h): Spatial, reverse playback, feedback
- Phase 4.1 (3h): Layout + basic controls
- Phase 4.2 (4-5h): Particle field visualization

**Key risks:**
- CPU usage with 64 voices (~50-65% estimated)
- Visualization performance overhead
- Buffer boundary handling for reverse playback
- Fallback: Reduce to 32 or 16 voices if CPU exceeds targets
