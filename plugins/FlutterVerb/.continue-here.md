# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 2 - Foundation Complete

Project structure created and verified. Build system compiles successfully.
Plugins installed to system folders (VST3 + AU + Standalone).
Ready to proceed to Stage 3 (Shell - parameter implementation).

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type defined: Audio Effect (Reverb)
- Professional examples researched (Soundtoys Little Plate, UAD Pure Plate, Valhalla Plate, LiquidSonics Lustrous Plates)
- DSP feasibility verified: All components implementable with JUCE
- Parameter ranges researched: Industry-standard reverb ranges documented
- JUCE modules identified: dsp::Reverb, DelayLine, IIR::Filter, DryWetMixer
- Codebase references analyzed: TapeAge (saturation, wow/flutter), GainKnob (DJ filter)
- DSP architecture created: 7 core components, complete signal flow diagram

**Stage 1:** ✓ Complete
- Complexity calculated: 5.0 (7 params + 7 algorithms + 1 feature = 9.4, capped at 5.0)
- Strategy determined: Phased implementation (complexity ≥ 3.0)
- DSP phases defined: 4 phases (Reverb, Modulation, Saturation/Filter, MOD_MODE)
- GUI phases defined: 3 phases (Layout, Binding, VU Meter)
- Implementation plan created: plugins/FlutterVerb/.ideas/plan.md
- Estimated duration: ~95 minutes total

**Stage 2:** ✓ Complete
- CMakeLists.txt created with JUCE 8 configuration
- Source files created: PluginProcessor.h/cpp, PluginEditor.h/cpp
- Build system verified (compiles successfully)
- Plugins installed to system folders (VST3 + AU + Standalone)
- WebView support configured (commented out until Stage 5)
- Bus configuration: Stereo input + stereo output (audio effect)
- Pass-through audio processing (no DSP yet)

## Next Steps

1. Stage 3: Shell (implement APVTS with 7 parameters)
2. Stage 4: DSP implementation (4 phases: Reverb → Modulation → Saturation/Filter → MOD_MODE)
3. Stage 5: GUI integration (3 phases: Layout → Binding → VU Meter)
4. Stage 6: Validation (presets, pluginval, changelog)

## Context to Preserve

**Plugin Type:** Audio Effect (Reverb)
**Processing:** Plate reverb → Wow/Flutter modulation → Tape saturation → DJ filter → Dry/wet mix
**JUCE Modules:**
- juce::dsp::Reverb (plate algorithm)
- juce::dsp::DelayLine with Lagrange3rd interpolation (pitch modulation)
- Custom LFOs (wow: 0.5-1.5Hz, flutter: 4-8Hz)
- Custom tanh waveshaper (tape saturation)
- juce::dsp::IIR::Filter (DJ-style LP/HP)
- juce::dsp::DryWetMixer (dry/wet blend)

**Complexity Score:** 5.0 (Complex)
**Strategy:** Phased implementation
**Estimated Duration:** ~95 minutes
