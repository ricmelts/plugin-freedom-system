# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for LushPad. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Generative lush pad with nested random modulation
- Parameters specified: 3 knobs (Timbre, Filter Cutoff, Reverb Amount)
- UI vision captured: Minimal 3-knob interface with subtle modulation visualization
- Use cases identified: Background atmospheres, evolving textures, harmonic beds

## Next Steps

1. Quick params + parallel workflow (18 min faster)
2. Full UI mockup first (traditional workflow)
3. Start implementation directly (requires existing mockup)
4. Research similar plugins for inspiration
5. Save for later

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Synth (Instrument)
- Core concept: 8-voice polyphonic pad with 3 detuned sine oscillators per voice, FM feedback, harmonic saturation, nested random LFO modulation creating generative evolving texture
- DSP: Slow attack/long release envelope, low-pass filter with fixed resonance, large hall reverb, velocity affects volume + filter brightness
- Modulation system: Random LFOs modulating panning/feedback/saturation, with LFO speed and depth themselves modulated by other random LFOs (generative, never-repeating evolution)
