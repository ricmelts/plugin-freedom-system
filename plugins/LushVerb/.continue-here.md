# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 0 - Research Complete

DSP architecture documented. Ready to proceed to planning (Stage 1).

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type: Audio Effect (Reverb)
- DSP approach: juce::dsp::Reverb + custom shimmer (phase vocoder)
- Professional examples researched (Strymon BigSky, Valhalla Shimmer/VintageVerb)
- Parameter ranges verified against industry standards
- Feasibility confirmed

## Next Steps

1. Stage 1: Planning (calculate complexity, create implementation plan)
2. Review architecture.md findings
3. Run deeper JUCE investigation (deep-research skill)
4. Pause here

## Files Created
- plugins/LushVerb/.ideas/architecture.md

## Key Decisions
- Shimmer routing: Pre-reverb (shifted signal feeds reverb input)
- Modulation: Built-in dual LFO, always-on, not user-controllable
- SIZE range: 0.5-20s (requires custom feedback scaling for long tails)
- Phase vocoder preferred for shimmer quality (fallback: granular/delay-based)
